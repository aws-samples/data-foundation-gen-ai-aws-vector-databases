    "In this lab you built a simple wine recommendation chatbot. In this particular lab you used Amazon Bedrock titan v2 model to create vector embedding for our data. Then we loaded this data in to a DocumentDB collection with a HNSW index on `description_vector` field. At search time, we used Amazon Titan v2 model again to convert our query question into vector embedding and used semantic search to retrieve results. These results were then passed on to Anthropic Claude Sonnet 3 model which was able to recommend us a wine from within our catalog. "
